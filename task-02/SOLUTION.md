Hi I am logeswaran.V.I have completed the task number 2
The git commands I used for that purposes are:
     1.I used git clone command to clone the respository.
     2.I used mkdir solution command to create the folder.
     3.I used mv oldfilepath newfilepath/newfilename command to move the file from a old location to the new location and renamed it.I tried cp command but for some reasons I don't get it right.So I choose an alternative path.
     4.git commit -a-m to commit our work.
     5.git branch -a to knew the local and remote branches.git checkout asia to switch branch.
     6.find . - name filename to find the file.

     8.cat *.txt>>newfilename.txt to concatenate the file.
